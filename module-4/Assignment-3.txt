DApp Development with Truffle and React

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to enable students to build a complete decentralized application (DApp) using Truffle for Ethereum smart contract development and React for the front-end. By completing this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience in creating a DApp that interacts with Ethereum smart contracts.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will initialize a new Truffle project, create a simple Ethereum smart contract with associated tests, and set up a React-based front-end for their DApp. They will connect the React front-end to the Ethereum smart contract using Web3.js for functionality like displaying contract data and making transactions. Additionally, students will deploy and demonstrate their DApp locally.

Instructions:

Truffle Project Setup:

Instruct students to initialize a new Truffle project. They can choose a suitable project name and directory structure.
Ask them to create a simple Ethereum smart contract within the Truffle project. The contract should include callable functions and emit events (if applicable).
Require students to write comprehensive tests for their smart contract using Truffle's testing framework (e.g., Mocha and Chai).
React Front-End Development:

Task students with setting up a React-based front-end for their DApp. They should use Create React App or a similar tool for bootstrapping the project.
Instruct them to design and build a user interface (UI) for interacting with the smart contract. The UI should include elements for user input and interaction.
Encourage students to implement functionality in the React app to read data from the smart contract (using Web3.js) and trigger transactions based on user actions.
Integration with Web3.js:

Students should integrate their React front-end with the Ethereum smart contract using Web3.js. This includes initializing a Web3 instance and connecting it to the Ethereum network (e.g., Ganache for local development).
They should implement JavaScript functions to interact with the smart contract's functions and listen to contract events.
Testing and Deployment:

Instruct students to thoroughly test their DApp to ensure that it functions correctly. This includes testing smart contract interactions from the React app.
Encourage students to deploy their DApp locally for testing. They can use development networks like Ganache or a local Ethereum node.
Demonstration:

Require students to demonstrate the functionality of their DApp. They should showcase how users can interact with the smart contract through the UI, including reading data and making transactions.
Students can record a video or provide screenshots to demonstrate their DApp.
Submission:

Students should submit their Truffle project, React codebase, and any additional assets required for their DApp.
Include a document or README file with explanations and instructions for using their DApp.
Grading Criteria:

The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the DApp, including smart contract interactions.
Quality and usability of the React-based UI.
Thorough testing and demonstration of the DApp's functionality.
Clarity and completeness of the submission, including explanations and instructions.
