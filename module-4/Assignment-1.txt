DApp Architecture Analysis

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to familiarize students with the architecture of decentralized applications (DApps). By analyzing the architecture of a real-world DApp, students will gain insights into how DApps are structured and how various components interact.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will choose a popular decentralized application (DApp) and conduct an in-depth analysis of its architecture. They will create a detailed architectural diagram that visually represents the components of the chosen DApp, including its front-end, smart contract components, and the interactions between them. Additionally, students will explain the purpose and role of each component in the DApp's architecture.

Instructions:

Choose a DApp:

Ask each student to select a popular DApp of their choice. The DApp can be related to finance, gaming, NFTs, or any other category.
Research and Analysis:

Instruct students to thoroughly research their chosen DApp, including its functionalities, use cases, and technology stack.
Encourage them to review official documentation, whitepapers, and available resources related to the DApp.
Architectural Diagram:

Require students to create a detailed architectural diagram of the chosen DApp. The diagram should illustrate the following components:
Front-end interface (web or mobile).
Smart contracts (including individual contracts and their relationships).
Data storage (e.g., on-chain data, off-chain databases).
User accounts and authentication mechanisms.
External APIs or oracles, if applicable.
Any other relevant components specific to the DApp.
Component Descriptions:

Ask students to provide explanations for each component in their architectural diagram. For each component, they should:
Describe its purpose and functionality.
Explain how it interacts with other components.
Mention any unique features or innovations within the DApp.
Use Cases and User Experience:

Encourage students to discuss the use cases of the chosen DApp and how its architecture supports these use cases.
Ask them to consider the user experience and how the architecture contributes to a seamless interaction for users.
Presentation (Optional):

If students are comfortable with presenting, give them the option to present their architectural analysis to the class, explaining the DApp's architecture and its significance.
Submission:

Students should submit their architectural diagram, component descriptions, and any additional insights or findings.
Grading Criteria:

The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Completeness and accuracy of the architectural diagram.
Clarity and depth of component descriptions.
Demonstration of understanding of the DApp's architecture and use cases.
Presentation quality (if applicable).
