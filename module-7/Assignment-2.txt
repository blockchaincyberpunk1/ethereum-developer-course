Open-Source Contribution

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to encourage students to actively contribute to open-source Ethereum projects, fostering collaboration, and enhancing their practical development skills.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will actively contribute to open-source Ethereum projects by selecting one project or repository from a provided list (or they can choose their own) and making a meaningful contribution. This contribution can take the form of bug fixes, documentation improvements, code enhancements, or the implementation of new features.

Instructions:

Project Selection:

Provide students with a list of open-source Ethereum projects or repositories that welcome contributions. Alternatively, allow them to choose a project of their own if they have a specific interest.
Encourage students to explore the projects' README files, contributing guidelines, and issues to identify areas where their skills and interests align with the project's needs.
Contributing to the Project:

Instruct students to:
Fork the selected project's repository to create their own copy.
Clone their forked repository to their local development environment.
Select a specific task or issue to work on, ensuring it aligns with their skill level and the project's guidelines.
Implement the contribution, following best practices and adhering to the project's coding standards.
Write clean and well-documented code.
Test their changes thoroughly to ensure they do not introduce new issues.
Pull Request (PR) Submission:

Task students with creating a pull request (PR) to submit their contribution to the project's maintainers.
Ensure they follow the project's PR template and guidelines for submission.
Students should actively participate in discussions related to their PR and be prepared to make necessary adjustments based on feedback from maintainers and the community.
Reflection Report:

After their contribution is accepted and merged or after the PR review process is complete, students should write a reflection report.
The report should describe the contribution they made, the challenges they faced during the process, and how they addressed those challenges.
Students should also reflect on what they learned from this open-source contribution experience, how it benefited their development skills, and any insights they gained about Ethereum development.
Grading Criteria:

The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

The significance and quality of the contribution made to the open-source Ethereum project.
Adherence to project guidelines and coding standards.
Effective participation in discussions and responsiveness to feedback during the PR review process.
The depth and relevance of insights gained from the open-source contribution experience as described in the reflection report.
