Smart Contract Auditing Process

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to familiarize students with the process of auditing smart contracts for security vulnerabilities. By conducting a basic security audit on a real smart contract, students will gain practical experience in identifying and assessing potential risks in Ethereum-based applications.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will learn about the steps involved in the smart contract auditing process. They will choose a real smart contract (e.g., from a public repository like GitHub) and conduct a basic security audit on it. The audit process should include code review, vulnerability identification, and the generation of a comprehensive audit report.

Instructions:

Overview of the Smart Contract Auditing Process:

Begin by providing students with an overview of the smart contract auditing process. Explain the importance of auditing and the steps involved, such as code review, vulnerability identification, and reporting.
Select a Real Smart Contract:

Instruct students to choose a real smart contract from a public repository (e.g., GitHub). The selected contract should be publicly available and related to Ethereum or blockchain development.
Conduct a Security Audit:

Task students with conducting a basic security audit on the chosen smart contract. They should follow these steps:
Perform a thorough code review to understand the contract's functionality.
Identify potential security vulnerabilities or risks within the code.
Use established best practices and known security patterns to assess the contract's design and implementation.
Document their findings, including details of identified vulnerabilities and their potential impact.
Generate an Audit Report:

Instruct students to create a comprehensive audit report that includes the following:
An introduction to the audited smart contract, including its purpose and functionality.
Detailed explanations of the identified security vulnerabilities or risks.
The potential impact of each vulnerability on the contract's security.
Recommendations and suggested fixes for addressing each vulnerability.
Code snippets or pseudocode illustrating how vulnerabilities can be mitigated or fixed.
Any additional observations or insights related to the contract's security.
Grading Criteria:

The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Thoroughness of the code review and vulnerability identification.
Clarity and depth of explanations in the audit report.
Quality and feasibility of recommended fixes or mitigation strategies.
Organization and presentation of the audit report.
Demonstration of an understanding of the smart contract auditing process and security best practices.
