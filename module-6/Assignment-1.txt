Security Vulnerability Analysis in Smart Contracts

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to familiarize students with common security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. By researching and analyzing a specific vulnerability, students will gain insights into the risks associated with smart contract development.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will delve into the world of smart contract security vulnerabilities. They will choose a specific vulnerability from a provided list, research it in detail, and prepare a report or presentation explaining the vulnerability, how it can be exploited, and its potential consequences.

Instructions:

Select a Security Vulnerability:

Provide students with a list of common smart contract vulnerabilities, including reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, unauthorized access, etc.
Instruct students to choose one vulnerability from the list to focus on for this assignment.
Research and Analysis:

Task students with conducting thorough research on the selected vulnerability. They should explore the following aspects:
Explanation of the vulnerability: What it is and how it occurs.
How the vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker.
Real-world examples of smart contract breaches or hacks related to the chosen vulnerability.
The potential impact on a smart contract, including financial losses or manipulation of contract behavior.
Report or Presentation:

Require students to prepare either a written report or an oral presentation summarizing their findings.
The report or presentation should include:
A clear explanation of the chosen vulnerability.
A detailed description of how the vulnerability can be exploited.
Real-world case studies or examples illustrating the consequences of the vulnerability.
Any preventive measures or best practices to mitigate the risk of this vulnerability.
Critical Analysis:

Encourage students to critically analyze the chosen vulnerability and its implications for smart contract development.
Ask students to consider the importance of security audits and best practices in preventing such vulnerabilities.
Presentation (Optional):

If students prepare presentations, organize a class presentation session where they can share their findings and insights with peers.
Grading Criteria:

The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Selection of an appropriate smart contract security vulnerability.
Depth and accuracy of research and analysis.
Quality of the report or presentation, including clarity and organization.
Critical thinking and thoughtful evaluation of the vulnerability's impact.
Consideration of preventive measures and best practices.
