Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to deepen students' understanding of blockchain technology by exploring different consensus mechanisms commonly used in blockchain networks.

Assignment Description:

Consensus mechanisms are crucial components of blockchain networks, determining how transactions are validated and added to the blockchain. In this assignment, students will research and present information about a specific consensus mechanism, facilitating a class discussion about the various mechanisms and their implications.

Instructions:

Select a Consensus Mechanism:

Provide students with a list of common consensus mechanisms used in blockchain networks, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), etc.
Instruct each student to choose one consensus mechanism from the list. Ensure that there are no overlaps, with each mechanism assigned to at least one student.
Research the Chosen Consensus Mechanism:

Task students with conducting in-depth research on the selected consensus mechanism.
They should gather information about how the consensus mechanism works, its key components, the roles of participants, and the process of reaching consensus.
Create a Presentation or Infographic:

Ask students to create either a presentation or an infographic that explains their chosen consensus mechanism.
The presentation should cover the mechanism's pros and cons, its strengths, weaknesses, and real-world examples of blockchain networks that use it.
Present Findings and Engage in Discussion:

Schedule a class presentation session where each student presents their chosen consensus mechanism and its characteristics.
After each presentation, facilitate a class discussion where students can ask questions and discuss the differences between the mechanisms.
Encourage students to explore the implications of each consensus mechanism on blockchain scalability, security, energy efficiency, and decentralization.
Evaluation:

Assess each student's presentation or infographic based on the clarity of the explanation, the depth of research, and their ability to engage in meaningful class discussions.
Grading Criteria:

The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Depth and accuracy of research on the chosen consensus mechanism.
Clarity and effectiveness of the presentation or infographic.
Active participation in the class discussion, including insightful questions and contributions.
Overall presentation skills and adherence to assignment instructions.
