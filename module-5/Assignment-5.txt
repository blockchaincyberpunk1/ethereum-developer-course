Yield Farming and Liquidity Provision in DeFi

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to the concepts of yield farming and liquidity provision in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. By researching and analyzing a specific DeFi protocol that involves liquidity provision and yield farming, students will gain insights into the mechanics, risks, and potential rewards associated with these activities.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will explore the world of yield farming and liquidity provision within the DeFi ecosystem. They will choose a specific DeFi protocol that offers opportunities for users to provide liquidity and participate in yield farming.

Instructions:

Select a DeFi Protocol:

Instruct students to choose a well-known DeFi protocol (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap) that involves liquidity provision and yield farming.
Ensure that the selected protocol has a documented history and a user-friendly interface for liquidity providers.
Research and Analysis:

Task students with conducting in-depth research on the chosen DeFi protocol. They should explore the following aspects:
How liquidity provision works on the platform.
Yield farming strategies available to liquidity providers.
Potential risks associated with liquidity provision and yield farming.
Historical performance, including APR (Annual Percentage Rate) or APY (Annual Percentage Yield) for liquidity providers.
Report or Presentation:

Require students to prepare either a report or a presentation summarizing their findings.
The report or presentation should cover:
An overview of the selected DeFi protocol.
Detailed explanations of how liquidity provision and yield farming function within the protocol.
Discussion of potential risks and rewards for liquidity providers.
Analysis of historical performance data, including APR or APY trends.
Critical Analysis:

Encourage students to critically evaluate the protocol's mechanics, potential challenges, and strategies for maximizing returns while minimizing risks.
Ask students to consider the sustainability and long-term viability of yield farming and liquidity provision on the chosen platform.
Presentation (Optional):

If students prepare presentations, organize a class presentation session where they can share their findings and insights with peers.
Grading Criteria:

The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Selection of an appropriate DeFi protocol.
Depth and accuracy of research and analysis.
Quality of the report or presentation, including clarity and organization.
Critical thinking and thoughtful evaluation of risks and rewards.
Consideration of the protocol's long-term sustainability.
