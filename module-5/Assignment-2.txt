Ethereum Token Standard Comparison

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to deepen students' understanding of Ethereum token standards and their respective use cases. By researching and comparing ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, students will gain insights into the features and suitability of each standard for different applications.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will explore three prominent Ethereum token standards: ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. They will conduct research to understand the features, advantages, and typical use cases associated with each standard. Students will then create a comparative analysis document or presentation to showcase their findings and discuss scenarios where each token standard is most appropriate.

Instructions:

Introduction to Token Standards:

Begin by providing students with an overview of Ethereum token standards, including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155.
Explain that each standard has unique characteristics and is suitable for different types of tokens.
Research and Comparative Analysis:

Instruct students to research and analyze each of the following token standards:
ERC-20: The most common standard for fungible tokens.
ERC-721: The standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), representing unique digital assets.
ERC-1155: A versatile standard supporting both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single contract.
Key Features and Characteristics:

For each token standard, students should identify and describe:
Key features and attributes.
Advantages and disadvantages.
Examples of tokens or projects that have utilized the standard.
Use Cases and Scenarios:

Task students with discussing scenarios and use cases where each token standard is most appropriate.
Encourage them to consider real-world examples and industries that benefit from each standard.
Presentation or Document:

Students can choose to create either a comparative analysis document (e.g., report or essay) or a presentation (e.g., slides) to present their findings.
The presentation or document should be well-structured, organized, and include visuals or diagrams if relevant.
Submission:

Students should submit their comparative analysis document or presentation as per the assignment submission guidelines.
Grading Criteria:

The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Thoroughness of research and analysis for each token standard.
Clarity of presentation or document, including well-structured content and visuals.
Insightful discussion of use cases and scenarios where each token standard is appropriate.
Overall quality of the comparative analysis and adherence to assignment guidelines.
