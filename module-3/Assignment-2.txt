Truffle Project Initialization

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to familiarize students with the Truffle framework, a widely-used development framework for Ethereum smart contracts. Students will set up a Truffle project, create a smart contract, implement a function, write tests, and interact with the smart contract using the Truffle console.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will initialize a Truffle project for Ethereum smart contract development. They will create a new smart contract within the project, implement a function, and write tests to ensure the function behaves as expected. Additionally, students will use the Truffle console to interact with their smart contract, demonstrating the functionality they've built.

Instructions:

Truffle Project Initialization:

Instruct students to set up a new Truffle project on their local development environment.
Provide them with guidance on how to install and configure Truffle if they haven't done so already.
Smart Contract Creation:

Task students with creating a new Solidity smart contract within the Truffle project. The smart contract should include:
A constructor function or initialization logic.
At least one public function with a clear purpose (e.g., store data, perform calculations).
Function Implementation:

Instruct students to implement the logic for the function(s) they defined in the smart contract.
Test Writing:

Require students to write tests for the function(s) they implemented. They can use Truffle's testing framework (Mocha and Chai) for this purpose.
The tests should cover different scenarios and ensure the smart contract functions work as intended.
Truffle Console Interaction:

Guide students to use the Truffle console to:
Deploy the smart contract to a local Ethereum development network (e.g., Ganache).
Interact with the deployed smart contract, calling its functions and checking the results.
Documentation:

Students should document their development process, including:
Code comments explaining the purpose of the smart contract and its functions.
Test descriptions that clarify the scenarios being tested and expected outcomes.
Screenshots or transcripts of interactions with the Truffle console.
Submission:

Students should submit their project files, including smart contracts, test scripts, and documentation.
Grading Criteria:

The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful setup of a Truffle project.
Creation and implementation of a smart contract with at least one function.
Writing of comprehensive tests for the smart contract's functions.
Correct use of the Truffle console to deploy and interact with the smart contract.
Quality of documentation, including clear code comments and test descriptions.
