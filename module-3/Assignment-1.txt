Remix IDE Setup

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to ensure that students have a functional knowledge of Remix, a widely-used online Solidity Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will be tasked with setting up the Remix IDE environment on their local machines or using the online version. Remix is a powerful tool for Solidity development, and having proficiency in it is essential for Ethereum developers. Students will also deploy a simple Solidity smart contract to their local Ethereum network using Remix, allowing them to practice the deployment process.

Instructions:

Remix IDE Setup:

Instruct students to set up their Remix IDE environment. They can choose to either install Remix on their local machines or use the online version at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Smart Contract Template:

Provide students with a basic Solidity smart contract template. This template should include essential Solidity code structures, such as pragma directives, contract declaration, and constructor function.
Deployment Task:

Task students with deploying the provided smart contract to their local Ethereum network using Remix.
Instruct them to interact with Remix's built-in development blockchain or connect Remix to a local Ethereum node (e.g., Ganache) if they prefer.
Documentation:

Require students to document their deployment process. This should include:
Screenshots of the Remix IDE during the deployment process.
Descriptions of the steps they followed.
Any issues or challenges they encountered and how they resolved them.
Submission:

Students should submit their documentation, which may include screenshots and written explanations, to demonstrate their successful deployment of the smart contract.
Grading Criteria:

The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful setup of the Remix IDE environment.
Accurate deployment of the provided smart contract.
Quality of documentation, including clear screenshots and step-by-step explanations.
Any creative or innovative approaches students used during the deployment process.
